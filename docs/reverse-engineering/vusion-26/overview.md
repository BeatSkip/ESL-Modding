The SES-Imagotag VUSION 2.6 BWR is a 2.6" E-Ink display with a resolution of 296x152 pixels. It is used in electronic shelf labels (ESL) and is part of the VUSION series of displays. The VUSION 2.6 BWR is a tri-color display, meaning it can display black, white and red colors. The display is controlled by an Axsem AX8052 Wireless MCU.

While most known SES Imagotags use a Ti CC1110 or CC2510 MCU, the VUSION series uses the Axsem AX8052. The AX8052 is similar to the CC1110/CC2510 in that it is a wireless MCU with an integrated 8051 core. The AX8052 is a bit more powerful than the CC1110/CC2510, with a higher clock speed and more RAM. However this line of products is completely EOL as of december 2022.
