# About
This repository contains all my work around hacking my own stash of electronic shelf labels.
Since I have a full-time job and this being just a fun project, i have no intention of 
commercializing this project. For this reason i will freely provide all information i have 
available under the MIT license. If you have any questions or want to contribute, feel free to contact me via github.

# Affiliation and intent
This project is not affiliated with any company nor is it endorsed by any company. It is not my intention to infringe on any company's properties nor 
is my intention to harm any company. I will put in my best effort that the security, integrity and value of the electronic shelf labels are not compromised and 
my efforts are purely for the purpose of making the labels interoperable with other systems in a non-commercial, hobby environment.
