## Introduction
The process of reverse engineering will be divided into several parts. The first part will be an initial review of the device, followed by an in-depth analysis of the internals of the device. 
After the initial hardware has been reviewed, i will go over the process of setting up the toolchain and the development environment. This will be followed by a series of projects that will be developed for the device.

## Initial review


## Analyzing internals


## Finding connections


## Testing setup
