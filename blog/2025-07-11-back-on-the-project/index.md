After a long hiatus, I am finally back on the project. Personal life has been quite hectic, but I am now ready to dive back into cracking the nuts of the ImagoTag ESLs. Looking back, it's been already about half a year since i last worked on the project, so I will need to get back into the groove of things. 

Current status:
- Vusion 2.6: Working bootloader, toolchain and flasher with basic 'hello world' functionality.
- G1 4.4: Pinout reverse engineering in progress, got the CC Debugger working on the debug header and setting up the toolchain.

If at all possible, i would like to create a shared source with minimal differences between the two firmwares. At some point i would like to get full OpenEPaperLink working, but that is quite a bit off. First getting some wireless functionality and showing some images on the displays would be a good start.
